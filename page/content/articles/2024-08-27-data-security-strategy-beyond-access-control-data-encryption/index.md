The cost, frequency, and scale of data breaches continue to rise year over year. According to the [IBM 2023 Cost of a Data Breach Report](https://www.ibm.com/reports/cost-of-a-data-breach){target="_blank"}, the average cost reached **$4.45 million** in 2023. The number of breaches and the amount of exposed records have also increased, with **over 22 billion records** compromised in 2023 alone, as highlighted in the [IBM Security Data Breach Report](https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach){target="_blank"}. So, what are companies doing to improve their data security?

## Common Data Security Vulnerabilities

### Misconfiguration

Cloud storage or databases are left publicly accessible due to simple mistakes. For example, [AWS S3 bucket misconfigurations](https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/03/leaky_s3_buckets/){target="_blank"} have led to numerous data breaches, exposing sensitive information without detection.

### Weak Authentication

Weak passwords or the lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) make it easier for attackers to gain access. [After a recent breach, Snowflake implemented mandatory MFA to enhance security.](https://www.spiceworks.com/it-security/identity-access-management/news/snowflake-implements-mandatory-mfa-following-major-data-breach){target="_blank"}

### Unencrypted Data

Data that isn’t encrypted during transit or at rest is fully exposed and readable if accessed by unauthorized parties. In the healthcare sector, more than [385 million healthcare records](https://www.hipaajournal.com/healthcare-data-breach-statistics/){target="_blank"} have been exposed in data breaches since 2009, many of which could have been prevented with proper data encryption.

### Insider Threats

Misuse of privileged access can lead to severe breaches, as seen in the [Capital One breach](https://duo.com/decipher/capital-one-breach-highlights-challenges-of-insider-threats){target="_blank"} in 2019. A former employee exploited a vulnerability in Capital One’s cloud infrastructure, exposing the personal information of over 100 million customers.

### Unpatched Software

Systems that aren’t regularly updated are vulnerable to attacks that exploit known security flaws. The [WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39901382){target="_blank"} is a good example of how regular software updates could greatly reduce the risk of data security incidents.

## Mitigation Strategy for Data Security Vulnerabilities

### Regular Audits and Monitoring

The most foundational step in mitigating data security vulnerabilities is conducting regular security audits and monitoring. Implementing tools to detect unusual activity, misconfigurations, or potential breaches in real-time enables teams to take quick action before issues escalate.

### Data Deletion

Deleting sensitive data is often the quickest way to reduce risk when a vulnerability is detected or when data is no longer needed. **Short-term,** this approach is highly effective because it immediately removes the data from potential exposure. **Long-term,** it doesn’t address the underlying vulnerabilities and may only provide a temporary fix. Additionally, this strategy can be constrained by legal, compliance, and technical requirements.

### Additional Access Control

Strengthening access controls is a common mid-term solution to prevent unauthorized access. This can include implementing policies like no public buckets by default in S3 or mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA), as seen with Snowflake. **Short-term,** access control can be highly effective in enhancing security by limiting who can access sensitive data. **Long-term,** its effectiveness may diminish if not consistently maintained or updated. Inconsistencies in implementation across different platform vendors (like Snowflake, Databricks, and AWS) can create complexity, slow down development velocity, and sometimes reduce the effectiveness of access controls as a security measure.

### Data Encryption

Encryption is a comprehensive long-term solution that protects data even if unauthorized access occurs. **Short-term,** encryption is highly effective because it immediately secures data, ensuring it remains unreadable without the correct keys. **Long-term,** encryption is the most effective approach because it provides ongoing protection as long as the keys are properly managed. Additionally, integrating encryption into your tech stack opens up the possibility of implementing advanced security features such as tokenization, data masking, and deterministic encryption, which further enhance data protection.

### Comparison of These Three Approaches

| **Approach**                  | **Short-Term Effectiveness**                                 | **Long-Term Effectiveness**                                                                            | **Level of Effort**                | **Challenges**                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Deletion**             | High—immediate risk reduction                                | Low—only a temporary fix, doesn't address root vulnerabilities                                         | Minimal                            | Legal, compliance, and technical constraints                                           |
| **Additional Access Control** | Moderate to High—effective in preventing unauthorized access | Medium—can degrade over time if not consistently maintained or updated                                 | Can slow down development velocity | Inconsistent implementation across platforms; may require regular updates              |
| **Data Encryption**           | High—protects data even if accessed                          | High—ensures long-term data security; foundational for advanced features like masking and tokenization | Significant engineering effort     | Requires re-architecting; technical complexity, but enables advanced security features |

## Advantages of Data Encryption

Encryption simplifies system architecture by reducing the need for complex access control, data governance, and extra security features on vendor platforms and developer tools. By protecting data at the core, organizations can spend less time and money on creating and dealing with extra approval processes and more on ensuring sensitive information is always private and secure.

### Long-Term Simplification and Reliability

Data encryption encourages simpler architecture over time by reducing the extra security features needed across individual vendor platforms, internal processes, access control policies, governance, and monitoring. This not only enhances long-term data security but also makes it easier to keep implementation simple and maintain compliance across an organization’s infrastructure and overall security.
