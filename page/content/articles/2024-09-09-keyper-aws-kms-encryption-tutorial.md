We're excited to share our new tutorial on [Keyper](https://github.com/jarrid-xyz/keyper-tutorial?tab=readme-ov-file#keyper-tutorial){target=_blank}. [Keyper](https://jarrid.xyz/keyper){target=_blank} v0.0.3 now supports AWS (in addition to GCP) for end-to-end data and file encryption and decryption. Whether you're a data engineer, platform engineer, or security analyst, this guide will help you securely manage encryption keys and protect sensitive data in your AWS cloud environment using [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/){target=_blank} and [KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/){target=_blank} in three simple commands.

## Why Use Keyper and AWS KMS for Data Security?

Data security is increasingly important, and encryption is one of the most effective ways to defend against unauthorized access. [Keyper](https://jarrid.xyz/keyper){target=_blank} streamlines [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/){target=_blank} role and [KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/){target=_blank} key management by automating the role and key creation and key rotation, simplifying permission management, and providing a clear, developer-friendly interface. [Keyper](https://jarrid.xyz/keyper){target=_blank} reduces the complexity of securing sensitive data, enabling engineers to focus on their core tasks while managing encryption and decryption operations with just a few simple commands.

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you’ll walk through how to:

- Set up AWS IAM roles and KMS keys for encryption and decryption using the AWS CLI.
- Manage encryption keys using [Keyper](https://jarrid.xyz/keyper){target=_blank} via [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/){target=_blank}.
- Encrypt a vulnerable file stored in S3 and ensure it’s protected against unauthorized access.

The guide is designed to be straightforward and practical, helping you implement encryption in your AWS cloud environment with ease, using AWS KMS for enhanced security without added complexity.

## AWS KMS Encryption: A Critical Part of Data Security

As organizations handle increasingly sensitive data, encryption becomes a key defense mechanism. Traditional access controls can prevent unauthorized users from accessing data, but encryption ensures that even if access controls fail, the data itself remains secure.

[Keyper](https://jarrid.xyz/keyper){target=_blank} integrates [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/){target=_blank} roles and [KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/){target=_blank} key creation and management via [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/){target=_blank}. It can be easily integrated into existing CI/CD pipelines, data, and tech stacks. This allows you to protect data beyond just at-rest and in-transit encryption, mitigating vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR and HIPAA using just a few simple commands and configurations.
