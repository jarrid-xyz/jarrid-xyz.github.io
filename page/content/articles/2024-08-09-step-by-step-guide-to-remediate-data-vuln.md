We're excited to share our new [Keyper tutorial](https://github.com/jarrid-xyz/keyper-tutorial?tab=readme-ov-file#keyper-tutorial){target=_blank} -- a step-by-step guide to remediating data vulnerabilities identified by popular scan tools such as [Wiz](https://www.wiz.io/){target=_blank} and [Dig](https://www.dig.security/){target=_blank} with [Keyper](https://jarrid.xyz/keyper){target=_blank}.

If you’re a data engineer, platform engineer, security analyst, this tutorial is for you. Whether you’re working with sensitive data in healthcare, finance, or any other area, knowing how to lock down that data with encryption is critical to address data vulnerabilities and keep your data safe and sound.

## Encryption as a Proactive Defense in Data Security

Sensitive data stored in cloud storage can be vulnerable to unauthorized access, even when traditional security measures are in place. Whole file encryption adds an additional layer of security by ensuring that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains unreadable without the decryption key.

Popular cloud security tools like [Wiz](https://www.wiz.io/){target=_blank} and [Dig](https://www.dig.security/){target=_blank} often identify vulnerabilities in files stored in cloud storage. While these tools are effective at detection, they don’t provide the means to automatically secure the data. That’s where [Keyper](https://jarrid.xyz/keyper){target=_blank} comes in, making it easy to encrypt these files and remediate the data vulnerability.

Encryption helps you to proactively secure your data at all times. By encrypting data, you ensure that even if vulnerabilities are discovered or security measures fail, the data remains secure and inaccessible to unauthorized users. This makes encryption a crucial part of the data security strategy.

## What You’ll Learn

In the tutorial, you’ll learn how to:

- Set up roles and keys for whole file encryption.
- Deploy and manage encryption keys using [Keyper](https://jarrid.xyz/keyper){target=_blank} via [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/){target=_blank}.
- Encrypt a vulnerable file stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and ensure it’s protected against unauthorized access.

The guide is designed to be straightforward and practical, helping you implement encryption in your cloud environment with minimal effort.

Whether you're addressing vulnerabilities identified by security tools or proactively securing your data, [Keyper](https://jarrid.xyz/keyper){target=_blank} provides a simple and effective solution. The tutorial focuses on using [Keyper](https://jarrid.xyz/keyper){target=_blank} as we try to simplify as many steps as possible for you, you can totally decompose it and re-implement [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) deployment on your own without using [Keyper](https://jarrid.xyz/keyper){target=_blank}.

As always, we'd love to hear from you.
